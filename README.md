# LearnHive

## Project Overview
LearnHive is an intelligent, adaptive assessment application that enables learners to transform any study resource (PDF documents or raw text) into personalized quizzes. The platform analyzes user performance and automatically regenerates more targeted questions to strengthen weak areas and ensure continuous skill improvement.

The tool is built using JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB, and the OpenAI API, offering an efficient, user-friendly learning experience.
